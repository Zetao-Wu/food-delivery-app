Developed a food delivery app that is fully functional and works with different servers that are specifically for the Admin and User. This project is a full-stack MERN application that focuses on role-based authorization with JWT as a secure gateway for user authentication. Furthermore, this application has integrated Stripe for a secure payment portal that is available for real-time payment.
